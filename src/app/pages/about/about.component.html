        <h2>Hello! I'm Diogo Vieira</h2>
        <p>
          I'm a European Computer Science graduate with a passion for building robust, scalable full-stack systems that combine backend reliability with engaging frontend experiences. I studied in both Portugal (ISEC) and Germany (HAW Hamburg), and I thrive in fast-paced, international environments, bringing a global perspective to my engineering work.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today, my main focus is building complete full-stack systems, from backend to deployment. I enjoy designing backend services with Java and Spring Boot, using PostgreSQL for data persistence, and containerizing applications with Docker. What I find most rewarding is taking these systems all the way to production. I deploy backend services to cloud platforms like Railway and build Angular web applications that communicate with them through clean, well-structured REST APIs. I also host frontend applications on platforms like Vercel, creating fully deployed, end-to-end systems. Building, connecting, and shipping complete applications is what I’m most passionate about, and it’s what I see myself doing long-term.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I’m not at my desk, you’ll likely find me:

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Creating Music:</strong> Playing guitar or diving into mixing and mastering.</li>
          <li><strong>Staying Active:</strong> Pushing my limits with calisthenics.</li>
          <li><strong>Exploring:</strong> Whether it’s fishing, reading, or traveling.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          I enjoy learning languages and speak Portuguese, English, and Spanish, with some knowledge of French and German. I’m always open to new challenges, so feel free to reach out, whether it’s to discuss backend architecture or music production!
